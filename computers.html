  <h1>Computers</h1>
  <p>One thing I like to do is work on computers. I have actually built a few at work, and because of that, I just wanted to showcase a few that I have worked on and built.</p>

  <h2>PC Build with AIO</h2>

  <p>This is one I built with an AIO cooler.</p>

  <h2>Laptop Teardown</h2>
  <img src="IMG_0419.jpeg" alt="Laptop disassembled for learning" width="600">
  <p>This is a laptop I took apart just to learn how it was built.</p>

  <h2>Tower Build with RTX 5070</h2>
  <img src="IMG_0421.jpeg" alt="PC tower build with RTX 5070" width="600">
  <p>This last computer is a tower build that has a 5070 in it, so I thought it was really cool.</p>
